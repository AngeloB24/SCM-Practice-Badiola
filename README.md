## What is SCM?

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the practice of systematically managing changes to software to maintain integrity and traceability. It includes version control, documentation, and change tracking.

## How GitHub Helps

GitHub provides version control using Git, allowing developers to collaborate, track changes, create branches for features or fixes, and merge code safely. It improves productivity and reduces the risk of errors in collaborative software development.
